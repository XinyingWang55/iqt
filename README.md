### Introduction
This repository contains Matlab codes for the IQT framework proposed in our recent NeuroImage paper "Image quality transfer and applications in diffusion MRI" (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917302008). 

### Disclaimer
0. The current version is limited to super-resolution of diffusion tensor images, although readily extendable to the MAP-MRI super-resolution or parameter mapping applications.

### How to use IQT framework

### Third-party re-implementations
There is a third-party Python implementation of IQT. Is it worth pointing people to this?
